                td Delete the results of a cubemoji command (if you were the one to initiate the command).

      h2 Cubemoji DM Commands
      p If you use a react or menu action on a larger server enrolled in big server mode, you will receive a DM from cubemoji containing your edited image. Included in that are instructions on how to opt out of messages with the dm_opt command.

      h2 Context Menu Commands
      p Right click a message to use context commands (only works on desktop Discord):
      img(src="/static/context-menu.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Right clicking on Discord menu to show highlighted 'Apps' menu with the submenu item 'Apply edit to this message'")

      h2 Moderation 
      p 
        | Cubemoji has built-in moderation features to cut down on spam in larger servers. By default, server owners are the only ones who can use moderation commands. However, they can delegate roles to make changes to blocked channels and emotes using the
        |
        span(class="font-monospace")/mod enrollment rolemod
        |
        | command.

      h3 Channel Blocking 
      p 
        | Channel blocking is enabled irregardless of whether Big Server Mode is enabled. This disables cubemoji from responding to slash commands, menu commands, and reacts in blocked channels. Channels can be blocked and unblocked with
        |
        span(class='font-monospace') /mod blacklist modify action:block/unblock channel: channelname

      h3 Audit Log 
        p
          | You can specify an audit channel to log changes made to moderation features using
