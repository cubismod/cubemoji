      h1 About cubemoji
      p Welcome to cubemoji, a multi-purpose Discord bot written in JavaScript and separated into several modules with multiple commands. The bot is maintained by cubis and if you would like it on your server, please DM cubis on Discord (cubis#0024). The bot's Discord is available at 
        a(href='https://discord.gg/Y6yzKwJUb3') https://discord.gg/Y6yzKwJUb3
      p Cubemoji has access to emojis on all servers it is added to, in addition to the
        a(href='https://mutant.tech/') Mutant emoji pack

      h2 Commands
      p All commands are implemented using Discord's Slash commands feature which is accessible in chat via
        span(class='font-monospace') /
      
      p Note that any commands taking in strings for emotes or image do support Discord Nitro emojis (except for 
        span(class='font-monospace')/info
      ) as well as basic unicode emojis in Discord like ðŸ¥º.
