### Updated July 3rd, 2022
*Based on [this template which is GPL 3.0 Licensed](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/privacy-policy-template)*


cubemoji takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

This [cubemoji.art](https://cubemoji.art) and the cubemoji Discord bot track basic information about their users. On the web, this information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. The Discord bot collects Discord user, channel, emoji information including IDs. Additionally, any content that you type into a cubemoji slash command, react, context menu, or other bot interaction can and may be logged.  

None of this information can personally identify specific users to this website as well as Discord bot. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, including logging to pinpoint bot performance.

In terms of what data is collected, it is generally Discord IDs which refer to specific API objects and are difficult to personally identify you as they have no meaning when not used by the Discord API.

If you have any questions about the data collected, feel free to reach out to us at the email on the bottom of this page.


## Cookies

cubemoji.art uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for caching and speeding up general website performance. Cloudflare utilizes a [bot tracking cooking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-cookies/) which is used to prevent DDoS and bot spam. No cookies are used for tracking or advertising purposes.


## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

cubemoji does not advertise your data or use it for advertising. Nor do we advertise on our site or in our bot. We strive to ensure that all our dependent services also do not advertise your data or use it for such purposes but they are goverened by their own policies. We encourage you to check out their policies.


## Security

Bot and website logs are stored in [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/legal/?plcmt=footer) for around 60 days retention. Database information and any other files that cubemoji stores are encrypted at rest using [Fly.io's app platform](https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/). Additional data backups are stored in [Wasabi S3 storage](https://wasabi.com/legal/privacy-policy/).
